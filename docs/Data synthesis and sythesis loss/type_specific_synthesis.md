# introduction

We discuss synthesis of various data types and synthesis loss to keep the 
various tutors working here.

## Tutoring and training

The tutoring process will proceed in:

* A training phase in which the tutor must learn to gener

## Musing

### Process

tutor(noise) -> dist
dist -> target

target -> autoencoder -> target_reconstruction
dist-> autoencoder-> target_reconstruction_from_dist
target, direct_target_reconstruction -> metrics

### Loss

autoencoding_loss = reconstruction_loss(target, target_reconstruction)
reconstruction_percentage = reconstruction_metrics(metrics)

tutor_reconstruction_loss  =
