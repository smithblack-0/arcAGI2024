# Research Notes: Reversible Models with Stable, Infinite Context Length

**Motivation:**  
Traditional LSTM architectures rely on gating mechanisms that often include erasure operations:
$[
y' = y $cdot (1 - e) + u
$]
This kind of update prevents unbounded growth of internal states and helps stabilize training. However, it might still suffer from numeric issues such as catastrophic cancellation and gradient instability, especially as sequence lengths grow large.

**Key Insight (Magnitude Manipulation):**  
The hypothesis is that the necessity of "erasure" is not just about zeroing out old information. Instead, it is about enabling control over the *relative magnitudes* of updates. An alternative view of the update:
$[
y' = y $cdot $text{erase} + u
$]
can be transformed (conceptually) into:
$[
y' = y + e^{($text{amplify})} $cdot u
$]
In this form, the gating mechanism allows the model to handle updates by adjusting magnitudes rather than strictly removing old information. Such a perspective may lead to more numerically stable infinite-context models, as the model adapts through relative scaling rather than destructive subtraction.

**Proposed Reversible Update Mechanism:**  
We consider a simple, coupled update system for states $($s_1$)$ and $($s_2$)$:
$[
$begin{aligned}
s_1' &= s_1 + F_1(s_2) $$
s_2' &= s_2 + F_2(s_1') $$[6pt]
s_1'' &= s_1' + H_1(s_2') $cdot (1 - G_1(s_2')) $$
s_2'' &= s_2' + H_2(s_1'') $cdot (1 - G_2(s_1''))
$end{aligned}
$]
Here:
- $($F_1, F_2, H_1, H_2$)$ are linear transformations.
- $($G_1, G_2$)$ are sigmoid gating functions.

By adjusting $($H$)$ and $($G$)$, the model can effectively emulate erasure or amplification as needed, allowing it to 
fine-tune internal magnitudes. This is analogous to how LSTMs use gates, but now cast into a potentially reversible 
framework that can handle longer sequences without losing gradients.

**Verifying Reversibility:**  
A critical advantage of this formulation is reversibility. Given $($s_1'', s_2''$)$, we can recover $($s_1, s_2$)$:

$[
$begin{aligned}
s_2' &= s_2'' - H_2(s_1'') $cdot (1 - G_2(s_1'')) $$
s_1' &= s_1'' - H_1(s_2') $cdot (1 - G_1(s_2')) $$[6pt]
s_2 &= s_2' - F_2(s_1') $$
s_1 &= s_1' - F_1(s_2)
$end{aligned}
$]

This ensures that gradients can flow backward indefinitely, potentially enabling stable training over infinite context lengths.

**Catastrophic Cancellation Mitigation:**  
Catastrophic cancellation occurs when subtracting nearly equal values, resulting in a loss of precision. In this formulation, if:
$[
H_1(s_2') $cdot (1 - G_1(s_2'))
$]
is extremely small due to cancellation, it means it has negligible forward and backward impact. Essentially, the dominant term remains $($s_1'$)$, ensuring that the update remains stable and effective.

**Relation to Existing Work:**  
- This approach draws inspiration from LSTM gating, but shifts the focus to magnitude manipulation rather than explicit erasure.
- Reversible architectures ($e.g.$, RevNets) have shown promise in providing stable gradient flow over long horizons. Extending such ideas to recurrent models could yield infinitely scalable context handling.

In summary, this line of thinking suggests a path toward reversible, magnitude-driven gating mechanisms that maintain stable long-term dependencies. By carefully controlling how information is updated—and doing so reversibly—the model can circumvent many of the issues that arise in classical recurrent architectures.
