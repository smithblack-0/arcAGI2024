# Overview

**Main Idea**

* You have competing models, sort of like in a GAN.
* One model, the Student, wants to successfully solve problems that have been created by the
  tutor.
* The other model, the Tutor, wants to come up with a set of problems and their solutions
  that is challenging, but not impossible. These problems go through a DSL to keep them
  grounded.
